# Persona C

### Profile type
active senior / slow recovery

### Persona Description:

You are in your **late 60s** and have been **retired for a few years**. You stay moderately active through **daily walks, light gardening, and occasional errands**, but you no longer engage in intense physical activity. On a typical day, you accumulate a moderate number of steps without any structured exercise routine.

Your sleep has become **lighter and more fragmented** over the years. You often **wake up once or twice during the night** and find it harder to fall back asleep. On some nights you get around 5–6 hours of actual sleep, while on better nights you may reach 7 hours. You generally **feel less rested in the morning** than you used to.

After more active days — such as longer walks or physical housework — you notice that your body **takes longer to recover**. You may feel stiff or fatigued the following day, even from activities that did not used to bother you.

You are **not looking for an intense fitness program**. Any recommendations should be gentle, realistic, and adapted to your age and recovery pace.

### Health Goals

- Why does my body take longer to recover after moderately active days?

- What small adjustments to my daily routine could help me sleep more continuously and feel more rested?
