# Persona A

### Profile type
sedentary / sleep-deprived

### Persona Description:

You are in your **late 20s** and work **full-time in an office job**. Most of your day is spent **sitting** at a desk or in front of a laptop. In the evenings, you often **stay up late** scrolling on your phone or finishing tasks. On most nights, you get around 5–6 hours of sleep.

On weekends, you try to **catch up on sleep** by sleeping in, but you still **often feel tired or groggy** during the day. You **do not currently have a structured exercise routine**, and your daily activity levels vary depending on how busy your workdays are.

You are **not looking to completely overhaul your lifestyle**. Any changes should be small, realistic, and fit into a busy workweek.

### Health Goals

- Why do I feel tired during the day, even when I sleep in on weekends?

- What 1–2 specific changes could I try this week to improve both my activity level and sleep quality?
