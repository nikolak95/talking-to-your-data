# Persona B

### Profile type
active / stressed

### Persona Description:

You are a **24-year-old student** who generally lives an **active lifestyle**. You regularly include high-intensity workouts during the week. 

Recently, however, your schedule has become more irregular due to **exam periods, late-night studying, and inconsistent daily routines**. Even though you stay physically active, you often feel **sore, restless, or not fully recovered**, and you sometimes wake up **not feeling refreshed**.

You want to stay active, but you are **not aiming to increase training volume further**. Any adjustments should focus on **recovery, balance, or pacing**, rather than doing more.

### Health Goals

- Why do I feel sore or restless even though I exercise almost 	every day?

- What should I adjust in my daily routine or training this week 	to recover better and reduce stress?
